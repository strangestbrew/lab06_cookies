Project title
Pat's Salmon Cookies E-Storefront
(lab06 Code Fellows 201 Salmon Cookies)

Motivation
Your friend Pat has come up with a business idea by combining two signature Seattle icons: Pat has developed a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies.

They're cookies made into the shape of a salmon, and actually made with salmon (though the fish is ground up so fine that you can't even taste it!) that is the ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a gray Seattle morning. Or gray Seattle afternoon... whatever. Tourists will go gaga for them, locals will begrudgingly fall in love with them, and Pat will make a ton of money.

It was my tasking as the project developer to create a cohesive brand image using Pat's (the business owner's) input, and to design a beautiful and functional web prescence to represent his product. Ultimate goals were to assist with point of sale tracking on an hourly basis, and to provide basic location information for all five of his locations.
